# DAYZ EXTERNAL

Quick little update on the Multi-Loader as I have seen many people losing access to their accounts. When you use your key it will get tied to your account with your User ID (not username) and the key won't be valid anymore logically as it is used. Once you are logged in go to Accounts tab and copy your User ID and save it somewhere you do not lose it. If you delete the launcher and redownload it, you will **ONLY** be able to log back in with your User ID and not the license anymore. If you lost access to your account they won't be replaced anymore, as this warning was given.



Make sure no third party anti-viruses are installed, Vanguard/FaceIT is uninstalled, and that you have disabled windows defender via dcontrol

1. Download overwolf recorder at this link :[https://download.overwolf.com/install/Download?Channel=web\_dl\_btn\&utm\_content=new-light](https://download.overwolf.com/install/Download?Channel=web\_dl\_btn\&utm\_content=new-light)
2. Open your game and put it in borderless fullscreen then quit out of it, and make sure it is not running at all.
3. Open overwolf and just let it run in the background, after that open the loader that you got in your email spam folder, register with your key, loader will close, reopen it, then login with your credentials.
4. Press Load Protection to load the driver (If it says Failed to load protection, it is due to you being on windows 11 which these products do NOT support. Downgrade your windows.), after that press on load \<your game>, loader will ask you to open game press OK on the popup.
5. Once in main menu press END Key to inject, and the menu key will be INSERT.
