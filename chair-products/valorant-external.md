# VALORANT EXTERNAL

### How to Inject <a href="#how-to-inject" id="how-to-inject"></a>

**Please**, before injecting, always restart your computer, as the injection process becomes safer. _**(Optional)**_

**Remember** that when injecting, you cannot have anything related to Valorant open, such as the Riot Client or the game!

**Make** sure there is no other anti-cheat running on your computer, such as Faceit. If there is, uninstall it.

As soon as you receive your key after your purchase you need to register then select option sign up to register, if you already have an account then log in, after you have logged into your account select the cheat you want which in this case is Valorant Internal.

Remember that the game must remain closed until the loader asks to open the game !

As soon as the game is selected your mouse/keyboard will stop working and after the loader completes the necessary steps your mouse/keyboard will start working normally again, after that open the new loader that was downloaded and log in again.

Once you have already logged into your account, wait for the loader to ask you to open the game, when it asks you just open the game and wait for it to do the necessary steps for a quick and safe injection, after that just enjoy the game !

here i am also loading bypass as well, but you can just of course skip that if you are just loading the cheat (ignore im using full, same as with icons)
