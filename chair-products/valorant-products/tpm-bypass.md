# ðŸ”“ TPM BYPASS

### How to Bypass <a href="#how-to-bypass" id="how-to-bypass"></a>

{% hint style="warning" %}


**This method will bypass the following errors**

* **TPM 2.0**
{% endhint %}

For the bypass to work, you must enable the following in the bios

* Secure boot
* TPM 2.0

After enabling all modules in the BIOS, open the spoofer, log in, and select "TPM Bypass". Then click "Start Bypass". Your mouse/keyboard will "freeze", and once the bypass is complete, they will work normally again, and you will be free to play.



{% hint style="success" %}
After you do the bypass for the first time, you only need to bypass again if you have turned off or restarted the computer.
{% endhint %}

#### Checking TPM <a href="#checking-tpm" id="checking-tpm"></a>

After bypassing TPM, it's always a good idea to check if itâ€™s really working.

* Press WIN + R and type "tpm.msc"
* Check if "Status" is stuck on a white screen
