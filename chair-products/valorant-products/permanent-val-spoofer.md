<summary>Bios Flash</summary>

_Flash your bios using a version higher than your current one or a lower one, remember to check compatibility and never flash it with the same current version._

#### **Tutorial:** <a href="#tutorial" id="tutorial"></a>

1. Download your BIOS file from the manufacturer's site (a newer or older version than your current one)
2. Go into your BIOS
3. Flash

#### **Here are some video tutorials for flashing the bios:** <a href="#here-are-some-video-tutorials-for-flashing-the-bios" id="here-are-some-video-tutorials-for-flashing-the-bios"></a>

[ASUS](https://youtu.be/Em7SRaG3L\_0)

[ASROCK](https://youtu.be/dUCWRqOdLUw)

[GIGABYTE/AORUS](https://youtu.be/DIIde3s02kM)

[MSI](https://youtu.be/sKMub20CUNI)

[BIOSTAR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBb0zH5FN6k\&t)

[X99 / X79](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnI53zsoAoM\&t)

</details>

**After flashing, we must configure our bios:**

AMD BIOSINTEL BIOS

DISABLE TPM 2.0 (Trusted Platform Module)

DISABLE Trusted Computing

DISABLE Secure Boot **and restore/install all secure boot keys**

Disable CSM (Compatibility Support Module)

Disable SVM (CPU Virtualization) in your BIOS

After that, save the changes and exit your BIOS

**Then check that the changes have been made successfully:**

* In windows, Press WinKey + R and type **msinfo32** and press Enter. Check if the value for **Secure Boot State** is **OFF**
* Press WinKey + R and type **tpm.msc** and press Enter. It should say no compatible tpm is found

**If it's as expected, we can continue with the tutorial**

<summary>Spoofing PC</summary>

#### Saving your old hwid <a href="#saving-your-old-hwid" id="saving-your-old-hwid"></a>

After you receive the spoofer loader, open it and create an account or log in if you already have one. Once you're logged into the loader, save your hwid, which will be displayed on the left side of the loader.

#### Spoofing <a href="#spoofing" id="spoofing"></a>

After saving your hwid, close all applications on your computer and start the spoofing process. Once you start the process, your mouse and keyboard will "freeze". After that, your internet connection will stop working momentarily and then resume as normal, along with your mouse and keyboard.

When the spoofing process is complete, restart your computer and check in the loader if your hwid has changed. **If it hasn't changed, enable "UEFI Spoof" and try again.**

</details>

**To bypass TPM 2.0 / HVCI / SB, access our other tab called** VAN RESTRICTION

**To bypass TPM 2.0, access our other tab called TPM BYPASS**

### Additional Spoofing <a href="#additional-spoofing" id="additional-spoofing"></a>

If you are still getting banned even after following all the methods listed above, or if you want more security when spoofing to completely avoid a ban, follow the methods listed below

<details>

<summary>Spoofing your GPU (Optional)</summary>

For spoof your GPU we will use the [DDU application](https://www.guru3d.com/getdownload/2c1b2414f56a6594ffef91236a87c0e976d52e0519bd313846bab016c2f20c7c4d6ce7dfe1991cc241d59b5c8cb07e5018b083a5902ac6c67fbe3b852ca022b0f73541638028a2d270eb576309b5208d7642bced763e8806fd9c5a9bca00d71e03e3f895d9924372aebbd01f8d3b8f4f22025884306c24b2230caaa33278d26e6030e42d33f8ae57a577520f01ba2e5ff243d0a889a561ab49c3ea2dd6c91d6ccaf1dfc1e0b09be33208abd34a0d614f24ab) to do this.

If the application asks to configure, just click "Close" and do not change the settings. After that, select your graphics card in the top right under "Select Device Type" and click "GPU". The application will automatically detect your graphics card, so you don't need to define it. After that, click "Clean and Restart" and wait for the application to clean everything and restart your computer. Once your computer restarts, download the drivers for your graphics card and install them.
