## HOW TO USE SUPER AUTO GREENER

Make sure to set Auto Green to offline when playing in mycareer and mycourt and online when playing in park, rec, pro-am, etc.

&#x20;Hold the shoot button until the player releases the ball `(No Need for timing)`

&#x20;Have at least 80 3pt Rating `(If you are using a S.A.G Tool Alone)`&#x20;

Must to be on open and make sure you are not contested, 60% chance you will miss even full white if you are contested by other player.

&#x20;Mostly Misses when you are doing fadeaway `(It lower your green window if you are not using the correct badges)`

&#x20;Set shot timing to "jump" for faster shot release

&#x20;![:redarrowright73:](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/1099406975575539723.gif?size=44\&quality=lossless) `Note: What auto greener does is locking on the green window in your shot meter if you get a full white but still misses it means the auto green cant lock on the green window because its too small or the green window doesnt appear in your shots. Make sure you have a good badges for your 3pt or use the park tool or the 2n1 to have all HALL OF FAME badges and MAX ATTRIBUTES for your player`
