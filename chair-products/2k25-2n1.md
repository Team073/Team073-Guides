## A.G

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/&#x60;15.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Auto Greener is our own tool to help you green all your shots. &#x20;

Works for field goals, dunks ( w/dunk meter), layups (w/shot meter) and free throws.&#x20;

UP-DOWN = normal skill dunk with meter

DOWN-DOWN = Rim hang skill dung with meter

If using AG on park, comp, ante-up, or any online gamemode, set the bottom drop-down option to ‚ÄúOnline‚Äù /‚ÄùDefault‚Äù&#x20;

If using AG on MyCareer, MyTeam, Play Now, MyCourt or any offline gamemode, set bottom drop-down option to ‚ÄúOffline‚Äù/‚ÄùMode 2‚Äù&#x20;

&#x20;

Do not change the top drop-down menu unless you are playing on KB & Mouse. &#x20;

Insert the Keyboard Key you use to shoot in the green box in order for it to work in this mode.&#x20;

## F.A.Q

Q:  Why isn‚Äôt SAG greening my shots?&#x20;

&#x20;

A: Make sure you follow the installation perfectly. If it still isn't working make sure you have a 70+ 3pt rating, and a high green window jumpshot. Remember that if you are trying it on MyCourt, you set mode to offline, and if playing park, set it to online.5%+ contested shots CAN be missed Overall fiddle with the Early/late it varies between different users due to Latency typically 0.0016 is the default sweet spot &#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/&#x60;16.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Q: Do badges/attributes stay when my key ends?&#x20;

&#x20;

A: No, badges nor attributes stay when your key expires, once you run the game without the tool, they will be reset.&#x20;

&#x20;

Q: Can I get banned for using this tool?&#x20;

&#x20;

A: Anything that involves abusing the tool for VC / progress boost, simcasting games, changing game score values on MyCareer will 99% get you banned. Just do what you are supposed to and you will not get banned&#x20;







## HOW TO USE SUPER AUTO GREENER?

Make sure to set Auto Green to offline when playing in mycareer and mycourt and online when playing in park, rec, pro-am, etc.

&#x20;Hold the shoot button until the player releases the ball `(No Need for timing)`

&#x20;Have at least 80 3pt Rating `(If you are using a S.A.G Tool Alone)`&#x20;

Must to be on open and make sure you are not contested, 60% chance you will miss even full white if you are contested by other player.

&#x20;Mostly Misses when you are doing fadeaway `(It lower your green window if you are not using the correct badges)`

&#x20;Set shot timing to "jump" for faster shot release

&#x20;![:redarrowright73:](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/1099406975575539723.gif?size=44\&quality=lossless) `Note: What auto greener does is locking on the green window in your shot meter if you get a full white but still misses it means the auto green cant lock on the green window because its too small or the green window doesnt appear in your shots. Make sure you have a good badges for your 3pt or use the park tool or the 2n1 to have all HALL OF FAME badges and MAX ATTRIBUTES for your player`
