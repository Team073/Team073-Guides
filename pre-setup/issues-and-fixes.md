<summary>Game crashing fix</summary>

If you are still experiencing crashing issues or “cheat not hooking, error 3” please try to:

Locate your game directory and delete "cod.exe" and "cod22.exe"once you do that it will download a new exe. After deleting the file, please run “Scan and repair” for Battlenet or “Verify game files” if you are on Steam. This will save you the time of deleting the full game and having to reinstall.

**Steam:**

`C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Call of Duty HQ`

**Battlenet:**

`C:\Program Files (x86)\Call of Duty_retail_`

If that does not work for you then you will need to use **REVO UNINSTALLER** and uninstall the game and redownload.

**REVO UNINSTALLER**

* Then uninstall the game and Battlenet or Steam whichever one you use
* Then restart pc
* Download the game and Battlenet or Steam again
* That should fix the CRASHING or BSOD issue

<summary>Delay Disconnects</summary>

This is not a method to not get disconnected. It is unpreventable. There is no way to not get disconnected.

This is how i play not to not get Dc'd but to prolong the time you can play on the acc while extend by days and even weeks if followed correctly.

What is **DC** or being **Disconnected** mean?

* Being disconnected from the game mean you got kicked from the game for either being reported by alot of players or you are on a new account (which is why you need an aged acc) beaming and playing like a streamer so of course they will know you cheating, it's also used as another way to prevent smurfing.

<!---->

* No, its not only just cause you are cheating in the game legit players have disconnected and even permanently banned. You can check Tiktok, Youtube, Reddit & Steam if you need evidence to see for your self Activision are just cunts.

<!---->

* A message will be displayed " Player kicked." that and only that message means that you have been disconnected. Not Server Disconncted or any of the sort that has to do with ur connection once you have been disconnected you are instantly shadowbanned here is what the dialog will look like.

So now that we understand what being disconnected means, how can we delay it?

To delay it, you'll need a well-aged account. The account level doesn't matter much. I've leveled up level 1 aged accounts to level 250 before experiencing disconnection. The account just needs to have at least 20,000 kills in either Modern Warfare 2019/Warzone Caldera or Modern Warfare 2/Warzone 2.0. You can use a fresh Battle.net account to link to the aged account, and the platform (Battle.net/Steam) doesn't matter. It all depends on how you play.

Now, let's get to the important details. You need to be a decent player who can engage in fights, read situations, and move well. You don't need to be as skilled as me, but you should be able to outplay opponents and appear legitimate. This is crucial to playing on any account for an extended time, even when you can see enemies through walls and never miss shots. Most cheaters play like bots with no movement, and that's why they need cheats. It's easy to spot a cheating bot, so our goal is to make the killcam look as legitimate as possible.

Now, let's talk about settings. We're not raging. The key to avoiding detection is not setting your aimbind key to the key you use to aim in. This would make you automatically lock onto the next person closest to you after downing someone, and we don't want that. Here are the settings: The aimbind key must match the key you use to shoot, so it only locks when you're shooting at someone. Set the aimbot field of view (fov) to between 5-8 fov, and the smoothness between 7-20. Lower smoothing makes the lock-on more abrupt. Keep the distance at least 150m, so you don't accidentally lock onto players out of cover if you forget to stop shooting. Set the aimlock to "any" or, in tight situations, use an override key for headshots. Only use the override key when necessary. No recoil can be used, but tone it down to 50-75%.

Visuals are up to you. You can use a UAV, walls, or radar, and the range can cover the whole map. It's your preference. Personally, I stay about 100m further than my aimbot.

Don't use exploits like long melee, clan tags, super slide, vehicle fly, airstrike, etc., as these are things normal players can't do.

Don't use the unlock all feature for extravagant items, especially on low-level accounts. It will raise suspicion. Stick to normal camos if needed.

When starting out, it's okay to die and not get many kills, especially on low-aged accounts. Dying is part of the game, and you don't need to prove anything to anyone. Avoid extreme situations that make you look suspicious. Take the death, come back, and try again.

For kills, start with at least 5 kills, then gradually increase to 10 kills or below. Once your games are complete, proceed with two games at 15 kills and two games at 20. This method should work, and you can become more aggressive.

Don't play for extended hours continuously. Limit your playtime to around 7 hours, as playing longer accumulates more reports. Take a break for an hour or two before returning to play.

If your account gets shadowbanned, wait it out for a week and then continue the process. You'll effectively "bypass" the disconnection system.

I AM NOT SAYING THIS WILL WORK FOR EVERYONE JUST PEOPLE ASK ME AND I THOUGHT ID LET YALL KNOW MY METHODS OF HOW I HAVE PLAYED AND KEEP MY ACCS FOR WEEKS SINCE THE REBIRTH DAYS.
