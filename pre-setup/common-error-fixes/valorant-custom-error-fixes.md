Error on vul found >> 1/2 This error is related to your version of Windows. To fix it, simply reinstall your Windows. It is recommended to reinstall to version Windows 10 22h2 19045.2006.

The formatting process will need to be different from the standard procedure because you need to download Windows Update Blocker (WUB) and save it to a USB drive (it can be the same one you use for Windows). After doing this, disconnect your computer from the internet and perform the normal Windows installation. Once Windows is installed, run WUB as Admin and disable Windows updates. After that, reconnect your internet and enjoy.
