# DAYZ CUSTOM ERROR FIXES

The only error you will encounter usually is "Failed to Load Protection!" meaning you are on windows 11 which these products do NOT support, so a reinstallation to windows 10 will be necessary, here is a guide for it : [https://youtu.be/OtHZueEZe9s](https://youtu.be/OtHZueEZe9s)

The other "error" you may see is features not working, but this is not due to an error, this is usually due to a recent game patch that just took place that we are not aware of yet. The fastest way to resolve this is make a ticket in our discord server and report this issue to us.
