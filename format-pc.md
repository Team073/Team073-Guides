# Format PC

if you have or want to reinstall i recommend windows 10 latest version

For a clean reinstall that makes your life alot easier i recommend installing GhostOS, it comes bloatware free meaning it strips out all the windows junk that is not needed and frees a lot of cpu usage it also comes packed with an application that makes reinstalling a breeze.
